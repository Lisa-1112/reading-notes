* What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Shared Belief in Safety: Team members feel comfortable taking risks, voicing opinions, and admitting mistakes without fear of negative consequences like ridicule, blame, or punishment. This sense of security arises from open communication, mutual respect, and a focus on learning from errors.

Psychological Support: Team members feel confident that their colleagues will listen without judgment, offer constructive feedback, and provide help when needed. This involves active listening, empathy, and creating a space where vulnerability is seen as strength rather than weakness.

Clear Leadership: Leaders set the tone by modeling open communication, valuing diverse perspectives, and taking responsibility for their own mistakes. They foster a culture of collaboration and inclusion, empowering team members to share ideas and participate actively.
