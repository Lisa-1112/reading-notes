What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive? 

The <canvas> element in HTML5 unlocks a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to achieve a wide range of functionalities directly within web pages. Drawing shapes and paths: Create lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, and complex paths using JavaScript, enabling dynamic visualizations and interactive elements.
Animations and transitions: Implement smooth animations and transitions, bringing life to your web pages and user interfaces.
Game development: Build the foundation for 2D games with collision detection, animation loops, and rendering of game objects.
Data visualization: Generate charts, graphs, and other data visualizations directly on the canvas, eliminating the need for external libraries.

What information should not be stored in local storage?
Sensitive personal information: This includes anything that could be used to identify an individual.
Names
Addresses
Phone numbers
Email addresses
Social security numbers
Passwords
Financial information (credit card numbers, bank account details)
Healthcare data

Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
Strings: These are directly compatible with local storage, no conversion needed. Just store them as-is using localStorage.setItem('key', 'value').
Numbers: Local storage converts numbers to strings automatically. While convenient, keep in mind that precision might be lost, especially for floating-point numbers. Consider stringifying them yourself using JSON.stringify if exact values are crucial.
Booleans (true or false): Similar to numbers, booleans are automatically converted to strings. If you prefer clarity, use JSON.stringify here too.

Image filters and effects: Apply filters like blur, grayscale, or custom image processing directly on the canvas.
Real-time image manipulation: Capture images from webcams or user uploads and manipulate them in real-time using JavaScript code.
Photo editing tools: Develop basic photo editing functionalities like cropping, resizing, and adding text overlays.

Chart.js Documentation:

What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?
Chart.js is a free and open-source JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs directly in your web pages. It's known for being simple, user friendly, Versatile, and Customizable.  High-performance: It uses HTML5 canvas for rendering, ensuring smooth animations and efficient handling of large datasets.
Also responsive: Charts automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes and devices.

List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.
Line Charts, Bar Charts, Doughnut, and Pie Charts.

Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js
Bar Charts: Great for comparing categories and highlighting differences in values.
Line Charts: Useful for showing trends and changes over time.
Pie and Doughnut Charts: Ideal for displaying proportions of a whole.
Radar Charts: Effective for comparing multiple variables for different data points.
Scatter Plots: Useful for exploring relationships between two continuous variables.
Color scheme: Choose colors that are visually appealing and complement your brand or theme. Chart.js offers various color palettes and options for customizing individual datasets.
Labels and tooltips: Provide clear and concise labels for data points and use tooltips to display additional information on hover.
Gridlines and axes: Adjust gridlines and axis styles to enhance readability and avoid cluttering the chart.
Legends: Use legends to differentiate datasets when you have multiple series.

What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?
How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?
Visualizing data I generate If I am given a dataset.
I can analyze it and provide summaries and insights.
Making my outputs more engaging: I can generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. By incorporating charts and graphs created with Chart.js, I could make these outputs more visually appealing and engaging for users.
