How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    Focus, and Use vivid language and imagery: Paint a picture with your words. Use a tiny robot building your creation as a great example. Use a object in your hand to help explain and a drawing on paper. Print on paper directions.
    My advise would be stay on topic ask your friend to explain what you said. Don't you abreavations speak clearly.  By following these tips, you can effectively describe an object to a non-technical friend in a way that is engaging, informative, and easy to understand. 


What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    Object literals are a popular way to create objects in programming, especially JavaScript. Here are some advantages Object literals use a simple and clean syntax, making them easy to write and understand. You can define properties and their values within curly braces, often in one line. This makes your code more readable and less prone to errors.


How do objects differ from arrays?
        Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
        Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? Ideally, object literals offer a convenient and effective way to create simple and flexible objects in your program. Weighing their advantages and limitations will help you choose the right approach for your specific needs.
        Objects: and arrays are both fundamental data structures used in programming, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics Use the key within square brackets or dot notation to access the corresponding value. For example, myObject["name"] or myObject.name.
        Objects: Unordered, key-value pairs, diverse data types, accessing by key.
        Arrays: Typically hold elements of the same data type, although some languages allow mixed-type arrays.Arrays: Use the index within square brackets to access the element at that position. For example, myArray[2] refers to the third element (remembering indexing starts at 0).
        Arrays: Use traditional for loops or methods like forEach to iterate over elements based on their order. Arrays: Ordered, numerical index, similar data types, accessing by position.

    Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
        Dot notation only works with valid JavaScript identifiers (letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs). If a property name has spaces, hyphens, or other special characters, you must use bracket notation.
        const propertyName = "city";
    const myUserData = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };
    onsole.log(myUserData[propertyName]); // Output: "New York"

    Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
    When the humanAge method is called (e.g., dog.humanAge()), this inside the method will point to the dog object.
    This allows the method to access and use the object's properties and other methods directly.
    The method uses this.name to access the name property of the dog object, which is "Spot".
    It also uses this.age to access the age property (2) and multiplies it by 7 to calculate the human age.
    Output:
    The console logs the message Spot is 14 in human years, correctly using the values from the dog object's properties.    

    What is the DOM?
    The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that represents the structure and content of a web page. It's like a tree-like structure where each element on the page is a node, and the relationships between them are represented by branches.
    Nodes: Every element on the page is a node, including text, images, buttons, and even the entire document itself. Nodes can have child nodes, creating the tree-like hierarchy.
    Elements: Most nodes we interact with are HTML elements, which represent specific parts of the content like headings, paragraphs, lists, and forms.
    Attributes: Elements can have attributes that provide additional information, like the ID or class of an element.
    Text: Text nodes represent the actual textual content within elements.
    How the DOM is used:

    Access and modify content: Web developers can use JavaScript to access and modify the content of any element on the page. This allows them to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
    Style the page: The DOM also allows developers to style different elements on the page using CSS.
    Add interactivity: By manipulating the DOM, developers can add interactivity to the page, like responding to user clicks, form submissions, and other events.
    Benefits of using the DOM:

    Structured representation: The DOM provides a structured and organized way to represent the content of a web page, making it easier for developers to understand and manipulate.
    Dynamic updates: The DOM allows developers to make changes to the page without having to reload the entire page, creating a more seamless user experience.
    Cross-browser compatibility: The DOM is a standard interface supported by all major web browsers, ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms.

    Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
Think of JavaScript as the builder and painter who brings the blueprint to life. It interacts with the DOM in two main ways:

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.


JavaScript can access any element in the DOM using its ID, class, or other selectors.
It can then change the element's content, attributes, or styles.
This allows for dynamic updates to the page without reloading it entirely.
Responding to Events:

JavaScript can listen for events triggered by user interactions (clicks, scrolls, etc.) or browser actions (page loading, form submission).
When an event occurs, JavaScript can execute specific code to respond to it, making the page interactive.
