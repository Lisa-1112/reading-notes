Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s. Early 2000s: Remember dial-up? The struggle was real! Video calls were choppy, laggy, and often dropped due to limited bandwidth. Audio calls, while more feasible, lacked clarity and suffered from frequent delays.
Today: Broadband internet with significantly higher speeds has become the norm. This empowers seamless video calls, smooth audio streaming, and even live broadcasts without hiccups.

Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
The src attribute specifies the source of the video file itself, pointing to its location on the server or locally.
**The controls attribute, when present, tells the browser to display the video player controls, allowing users to interact with the video (play,
**Here's a more detailed explanation of each attribute and its usage:
src Attribute: **Purpose: ** To define the URL of the video file that you want to embed on the webpage. **Syntax: ** <video src="URL_of_the_video_file">
**Value: ** It takes a string value, which is the absolute or relative URL of the video file. **Essential: ** Yes, it's a required attribute for the <video> element.

Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
Best Practices for Fallback Content:
Offer a brief overview of the video's content within a paragraph or link to a transcript.
Include Links to Downloadable Videos:
Allow users to download the video in a compatible format for offline viewing.
Consider Using a Poster Image:
Display a static image representing the video's content, enhancing visual appeal.
Handle Errors Gracefully:
Use JavaScript to detect playback errors and display appropriate fallback messages.
Test Thoroughly:
Ensure fallback content works correctly in various browsers and scenarios.

Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

n the dusty corners of an abandoned website, Audio and Video huddled, whispering dreams amongst cobwebs. Audio, a melancholic melody lost in static, longed for the warmth of human ears. Video, a faded film flickering faintly, craved the dazzle of a projector's light.
One day, a curious explorer stumbled upon them. Mesmerized by their whispers, he carefully lifted them, gently brushing away the dust. "Tell me your stories," he breathed, his voice a spark in their desolate world.
Audio poured out a river of forgotten laughter and tales of soaring emotions. Video, in response, painted shimmering memories across the explorer's mind, vibrant scenes danced to life. As they shared their fragments, the explorer wove them together, creating a breathtaking tapestry of forgotten memories.
Suddenly, they weren't just lost stories anymore. They were a window into a world once loved, a reminder of the power of shared experiences. The explorer, touched by their beauty, shared them with others. Slowly, light returned to their world, not from screens, but from the kindled fires of shared emotions.
Audio and Video, no longer just forgotten media, learned a new kind of magic - the magic of connection, the magic of stories that live on, not in pixels, but in the hearts of those who listen. And though the website remained abandoned, within it bloomed a vibrant garden of memories, forever echoing the whispers of forgotten laughter and faded films.

How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Dimensionality: Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox is suited for one-dimensional arrangements.
Control: Grid offers precise placement using grid lines, while Flexbox focuses on flexible distribution within constraints.
Complexity: Grid is more powerful for complex layouts, while Flexbox is simpler and often faster to implement for basic structures.

Grid container, grid item,and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences. 
 In web development:
A grid container is a layout system in CSS Grid Layout that uses a two-dimensional grid of rows and columns to arrange content on a web page.
Grid items are boxes in a grid container that represent in-flow content
Grid lines are a visual structure of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines that create a framework for organizing and aligning elements.

Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
Faster loading times, Better readability and accessibility, Optimized layout and flow, Reduced bandwidth usage, Improved search engine ranking, Reduced server load by Serving smaller images reduces the overall data transferred from the server, improving server performance and scalab.

Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
Explanation: Each comma-separated value in the list represents an image source and its width (in pixels, followed by "w"). The browser uses this information to choose the best image for the current viewport. The sizes Attributes provides hints to the browser about the intended display size of the image in different scenarios, helping it make more accurate image choices. Syntax is the value consists of media conditions (e.g., (max-width: 600px)) followed by the intended display width of the image in that condition.
Browser checks for screen size: If the screen width is less than or equal to 480px, the browser will use the smaller image (small-image.jpg) with a display width of 320px.
Browser checks for wider screens: For screens wider than 480px, the browser will use the medium-sized image (medium-image.jpg) with a display width of 640px.
Browser considers pixel density: The browser may also factor in pixel density to choose a higher-resolution image for devices with denser screens, even if the screen size is relatively small.
Default image: The src attribute provides a fallback image (default-image.jpg) for browsers that don't support srcset and sizes.

How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
Performance: By serving different image sizes based on the viewport or device pixel density, srcset delivers smaller images to smaller screens, reducing download times and improving user experience. This is especially crucial for mobile users with limited data plans.
Automatic Optimization: You define different image sizes and the browser efficiently chooses the most appropriate one based on the user's context, eliminating the need for manual calculations or JavaScript logic.
Cache Usage: Browsers can intelligently cache different image sizes, further improving loading times for subsequent visits.
Simplicity: Implementing srcset is relatively straightforward compared to writing complex JavaScript code for adaptive image loading.

JavaScript might be helpful:
Complex Image Handling: If you need more granular control over image selection based on specific user conditions or device features, JavaScript can offer greater flexibility.
Legacy Browser Support: For older browsers not supporting srcset, you might need CSS fallbacks like media queries.
Dynamic Image Transformations: If images require manipulation like cropping or resizing before display, JavaScript might be necessary.
